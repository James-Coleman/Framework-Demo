#  Welcome to my Framework Demo

## It is my intention for this repo to use some of the my favourite dependancies to show how making a modern, reactive app can be simple, reproducible, and fun.

## Among the dependancies I'll be using are:

- Realm
To save data of a variety of formats easily and quickly.

- RxRealmDataSources
To automatically observe changes to the Realm database and reflect them in the view.

- RxMoya
To quickly setup a familiar and reproducible API pattern for network requests, and to abstract these into a seperate container.

- RxFlow
To declare the routing for the app in a dedicated layer, to make navigation and app flow intent clear and structured.

- Eureka
To create tables to show custom data easily and quickly.

- Hero
To create elegant transition animations from one view controller to another during segues, creating a seamless experience for the user. 

- SwiftEntryKit
To elegantly show notifications of events, such as the loss of network connectivity. 

## Future dependancies

It is my intention to implement:

- SwiftLint
To provide a consistant code style

- HGPlaceholders (or similar)
To show a loading message (or no data message) when a tableview is empty
